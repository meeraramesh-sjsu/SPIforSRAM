# SPI for SRAM

The project is regarding the design and implementation of an SPI interface for a SRAM. The implementation involves transmitter and receiver architecture for SPI interface. 

This project also focuses on the block diagram and counter-decoder representation of controller unit. The whole timing diagram is achieved through simulation which is done using the Verilog Hardware Description language (HDL).
